- Forgot/reset password flow

### 🎨 UX
- **Light / Dark / System** theme toggle
- Responsive design with mobile sidebar
- Framer Motion animations

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarekul42/wallet-management-client
cd wallet-management-client
bun install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Configure the environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_BASE_URL` | Backend API base URL | `http://localhost:5000/api/v1` |
| `VITE_DEMO_USER_EMAIL` | Demo user email for quick login | `demo.user@example.com` |
| `VITE_DEMO_USER_PASSWORD` | Demo user password | `DemoUser123!` |
| `VITE_DEMO_AGENT_EMAIL` | Demo agent email | `demo.agent@example.com` |
| `VITE_DEMO_AGENT_PASSWORD` | Demo agent password | `DemoAgent123!` |
| `VITE_DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Demo admin email | `demo.admin@example.com` |
| `VITE_DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Demo admin password | `DemoAdmin123!` |

### 3. Run

```bash
bun run dev
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## User Flow

```
/explore                 → Browse all services
/explore/:id             → Service details & reviews
/checkout/:id            → Enter amount, see fee, pay with wallet
/dashboard               → Auto-redirects to role dashboard
/dashboard/user          → Full user dashboard with My Purchases
```

### Quick Login
The Login page has one-click buttons for **User**, **Agent**, and **Admin** that auto-fill credentials from `VITE_DEMO_*` environment variables.

## Security Notes

### Why Third-Party Login (Google / Facebook OAuth) Was Removed

This application previously supported Google and Facebook OAuth for social login. These were removed to maintain the highest level of security and control over authentication in a financial application:

1. **Dependency on external identity providers** — OAuth relies on third-party services whose availability, security posture, and data-handling policies are outside our control. A compromise at the provider level could affect user accounts.

2. **Account recovery complexity** — For a wallet app handling real or simulated funds, having multiple auth paths (email/password + social logins) creates ambiguity in account recovery and password reset flows. Users who signed up via OAuth may not have a password, complicating support scenarios.

3. **Attack surface reduction** — Removing OAuth eliminates the need for `passport-google-oauth20`, `passport-facebook`, and their associated session/callback handling. This reduces the dependency footprint, the number of HTTP endpoints exposed, and the potential for SSRF or redirect-based attacks.

4. **Simpler threat model** — With only email/password + JWT-based auth, the security model is straightforward: rate-limited login, bcrypt-hashed passwords, httpOnly refresh tokens, and sessionStorage access tokens. No additional OAuth token management or state parameter handling is required.

Authentication is now limited to email/password credentials with JWT access/refresh token rotation, providing a fully self-contained auth system.
